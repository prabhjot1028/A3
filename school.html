                        As stated in my "Home" page, I go to Dalhousie University and am enrolled in the Bachelors of Computer Science program.
                        For High School, I went to Salwan Public School in my home town New Delhi, India.
                        In my 12th Board Examinations, I got a staggering 96.4% which was the highest in my high school and at Dal, currently I have a 3.78 GPA
                        I also have some part-time work experience wherein I worked as a cashier at a North Indian Restaurant "Ada-e-Handi". Moreover, I interned at Thought-Rover inc which provides counselling services to students looking to study abroad and help them in their visa application,
                        I worked as a Customer and Technical services representative.
